This module introduces the basics of the VHDL language for logic design. It describes the use of VHDL as a design entry method for logic design in FPGAs and ASICs. To provide context, it shows where VHDL is used in the FPGA design flow. Then a simple example, a 4-bit comparator, is used as a first phrase in the language. VHDL rules and syntax are explained, along with statements, identifiers and keywords. Finally, use of simulation as a means of testing VHDL circuit designs is demonstrated using ModelSim, a simulator software tool. Programming assignments are used to develop skills and reinforce the concepts presented.
