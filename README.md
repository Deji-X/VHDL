# VHDL
My VHDL codes for personal projects. You may also see some of Sanchit's VLSI Roadmap Solutions in VHDL.
VHDL and Verilog HDL, differ, from one another.
Both are essentially Hardware Languages, but one is more concise and the other more structured.
Most of this codes were written on Simulink, other IDEs were used but not at initial time.

Each Project or Solution should not be copied word for word, just for idea purposes.
